# STACK v2.0 Notes

- This file (SHA256SUMS_stack_v2.0.txt) assumes a “stack layout”: each repo checked out as a sibling directory under one root.
- Evidence pack is part of L4 operations, therefore it lives in:
  ester-reality-bound/evidence/
- Any references to evidence under sovereign-entity-recursion are legacy and were corrected to L4.

Bridges:
- Explicit bridge (c=a+b): b includes evidence procedure + hashes; c becomes checkable.
- Hidden bridge #1 (Ashby): perimeter variety must match control variety (checklists + change logs).
- Hidden bridge #2 (Cover & Thomas): SHA-256 manifests compress trust into short verifiable strings.

Earth paragraph:
- Treat perimeter evidence like maintenance logs for power + thermal systems: without dated snapshots and hashes, failures become stories, not procedures.

## PDF variants in stack v2.0
The stack manifest lists only repository-tracked artifacts.
PDF variants for some texts may exist as release/Zenodo assets, but are not referenced here unless committed in-repo.
Canonical text sources remain:
- manifesto/Cybernetic_Stability_Manifest_v2.0.md
- ontology/Axiom_of_Volition_Inheritance_{EN,RU}.md
