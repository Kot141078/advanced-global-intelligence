# AGI (Advanced Global Intelligence) / SER / L4 — Master Entry (Canonical Reading Path)

**Important naming note:** In this stack, **AGI = Advanced Global Intelligence**
(repository: `Kot141078/advanced-global-intelligence`) — **not** “Artificial General Intelligence”
(the common meaning of “AGI” in mainstream AI discourse). Use the full expansion whenever possible.

This page is the single entry point for the public protocol stack:
**AGI (Advanced Global Intelligence context) → SER (normative spec) → L4 (reality-bound materials)**.

Note: the stack order above is conceptual. Reading tracks below are optimized per audience.

## 0) Choose your track (start here)

### Track A — Audit / compliance / governance (fast, “show me evidence”)
1) **SER normative specification (start here)**
   - Repo: `Kot141078/sovereign-entity-recursion`
   - Start: `README.md` → `DOC_MAP.md` → `pdf/` → `hashes/` → `protocol/`

2) **L4 operational materials (how it behaves in reality)**
   - Repo: `Kot141078/ester-reality-bound`
   - Start: `protocol/` → `hashes/` → `docs/` (glossary/constraints) → `posts/` (optional)

3) **AGI = Advanced Global Intelligence (system context & cross-repo integrity)**
   - Repo: `Kot141078/advanced-global-intelligence`
   - Start: `INDEX.md` → `protocols/` → `architecture/` → `hashes/`

### Track B — Technical reader (deep)
1) `advanced-global-intelligence/INDEX.md` (AGI = Advanced Global Intelligence — canonical map)
2) `advanced-global-intelligence/protocols/` (AGI stack layers, scope)
3) `sovereign-entity-recursion/protocol/` + `pdf/` (SER normative core)
4) `ester-reality-bound/protocol/` + `docs/` + `posts/` (L4 operationalization)

---

## 1) Repositories and roles (one sentence each)

- **AGI (Advanced Global Intelligence) = `advanced-global-intelligence`**
  — architectural context + protocol stack + cross-repository integrity manifests.
- **SER = `sovereign-entity-recursion`**
  — **SER normative specification** (protocol, PDFs, hashing).
- **L4 = `ester-reality-bound`**
  — public-facing L4 materials (notes, protocol, posts) with repo hygiene (SECURITY / CONTRIBUTING / CITATION).

---

## 2) Integrity / paper trail (how to verify)

- Each repo contains a `hashes/` directory with SHA-256 manifests or hashing instructions.
- Rule: normative artifacts change only with explicit version bump + updated integrity manifests.

Minimal verification mindset:
- “I do not trust text.” → verify **hashes**, **PDFs**, **commit/release references**, and **change logs**.

---

## 2.5) Minimal Evidence Pack (operational, copy/paste friendly)

If you need to reproduce the “Ivan-style” perimeter quickly (home / lab / small org):
- Repo: `Kot141078/ester-reality-bound`
- Path: `evidence/`
  - `room_checklist.md`
  - `power_chain_diagram.md` + `pdf/Power_Chain_Diagram_Evidence_v0.1.pdf`
  - `perimeter_snapshot.example.json`
  - `perimeter_change.example.json`
  - `README.md`

Purpose: a reviewer can verify a node/room perimeter without inventing formats.
Verification: SHA-256 hashes are recorded in repo manifests (see `hashes/` or top-level `SHA256SUMS`).

---

## 3) Versioning rule (to prevent confusion)

- **SER sets the normative version.**
- AGI (Advanced Global Intelligence) and L4 repositories reference SER versions as compatible layers,
  without redefining the core.

---

## 4) Administrative submissions (practical note)

For official review, prefer **PDF artifacts + SHA-256 manifests** (release assets or `pdf/` + `hashes/`),
and keep email bodies minimal (“Details in attached PDF”).
Official: see `/official/` (pitch sheet + print-ready PDFs + hashes).
Latest ecosystem snapshot (SER): ecosystem-v0.2-2026-02-24 (GitHub Release).

## Bridges (required)

**Explicit bridge:** `c = a + b`
- `a` = accountable human anchor (authorship / responsibility)
- `b` = procedures + protocols + PDFs + integrity manifests
- `c` = a checkable, citeable public corpus

**Hidden bridge #1 (Ashby):**
variety is achieved via separate repos (spec/context/operations),
but stability requires a single regulator: **this Master Entry**.

**Hidden bridge #2 (Cover & Thomas):**
SHA-256 manifests compress “trust bandwidth”:
verification is transmitted as short, checkable strings instead of narrative.

**Earth paragraph (engineering):**
This structure mirrors aviation-grade documentation:
*system overview* (AGI = Advanced Global Intelligence),
*normative spec* (SER),
*operational bulletins* (L4 posts) —
different documents, one truth source, reproducible checksums.
