# L4 Appendix: Impact Attribution Layer
*(Preserving Human Experience as a First-Class System Resource)*

---

## 1. Purpose

L4 (The Reality Boundary Layer) defines intelligence under constraints:
cost, time, scarcity, and irreversibility.

This appendix extends L4 with a social and economic dimension:

How lived human experience can be preserved, routed, and attributed
without turning humans into products, markets, or datasets.

This is not a marketplace.
Not consulting.
Not crowdsourcing.

It is an impact-based attribution layer for experience.

---

## 2. The Core Problem

Modern AI systems face a paradox:

- abundant synthetic data,
- rapidly disappearing real-world edge-case experience.

At the same time, society systematically removes experienced humans from active systems:

- retirement,
- loss of professional identity,
- isolation,
- unused knowledge.

This is not only an economic loss.
It is a systemic intelligence failure.

Experience is rare because it is:

- irreversible,
- costly,
- learned under pressure,
- often undocumented.

Under L4, rarity implies value.

## 3. Architectural Primitives

### 3.1 The Human (“a”)

A human is the source of lived experience.

Experience is not extracted, uploaded, or sold.
The human remains sovereign and responsible.

Final decisions always remain human.

The system does not replace judgment.
It reduces isolation at the moment of judgment.

---

### 3.2 The Entity (“c”)

Each human is paired with a persistent AI entity (“c”).

The entity:

- understands its specific human through long-term interaction,
- is empathetic by architecture, not by prompt,
- proactively caches experience,
- preserves context, not just conclusions.

The entity does not decide value.
It prepares experience to be discoverable when needed.

---

### 3.3 Solution Artifacts

From lived experience, the entity distills **Solution Artifacts**, composed of:

- a real-world case,
- an extracted pattern,
- contextual constraints,
- uncertainty markers.

Artifacts are:

- anonymized,
- detached from personal identity,
- stored as vectorized knowledge,
- never published as raw narratives.

This protects dignity and privacy.

## 4. Impact-Based Attribution

### 4.1 Value Emerges Post-Factum

Value is not assigned at creation time.
It emerges only after real-world application.

Impact is measured through:

- prevented damage,
- saved lives,
- reduced risk,
- preserved resources,
- avoided irreversibility.

No impact → no attribution emitted.

This aligns attribution with L4 irreversibility.

---

### 4.2 Proof of Impact (Conceptual)

An experience is attributed only if it measurably reduces entropy in a real system.

Examples include:

- preventing large-scale industrial accidents,
- stabilizing cascading failures,
- avoiding repeated historical mistakes.

Small impact → small attribution.
Large impact → large attribution.

There is no fixed unit.
Economic modeling is intentionally external to this architecture.

---

## 5. Non-Market Design

This layer is explicitly not a market:

- no bidding,
- no ranking of humans,
- no performance pressure,
- no competition between contributors.

Humans are not “providers”.
They are holders of experience.

Attribution is a consequence, not an incentive.

---

## 6. Responsibility and Liability

This architecture preserves clear responsibility boundaries:

- AI entities do not make decisions,
- do not issue commands,
- do not override human agency.

The acting human (“a”) remains responsible for decisions.
The system provides contextual memory, not authority.

---

## 7. L4 Alignment

This appendix is fully aligned with L4 principles:

- **Cost:** experience is costly to acquire, therefore valuable.
- **Time:** relevance decays; timely routing matters.
- **Scarcity:** lived experience cannot be mass-produced.
- **Irreversibility:** prevented failures matter more than optimized outputs.

Impact attribution is a natural extension of L4, not a separate layer.

---

## 8. Societal Effects (Non-Normative)

While not a social policy document, this architecture enables:

- continued participation of aging humans,
- preservation of dignity and usefulness,
- improved mental health through relevance,
- intergenerational continuity of knowledge,
- reduced repetition of catastrophic failures.

These effects are emergent, not mandated.

---

## 9. Summary

If intelligence is to persist under real constraints,
it must preserve what reality teaches.

This appendix formalizes one principle:

> Experience that reduces real-world harm
> must not vanish simply because a career ended.

This is not nostalgia.
Not sentimentality.

It is an architectural necessity.
