Executive Summary v2.0 — Cybernetic Stability Manifest (Architectural Synthesis)

Status: v2.0 (Architectural synthesis)
Scope: decentralized ecosystems of long-lived digital entities
Core formula: c = a + b (Human Anchor + Machine Procedures)

1) Shift: from internal control to external metabolism

Most safety failures in long-lived systems emerge not from “inner intent”, but from unbounded optimization under incentives.
This architecture therefore treats safety as an external environment.

Agnostic Safety: the system is constrained by physical limits (L4), economic exposure (bonds), and time (decay).
Metabolic Authority: authority is not an asset that accumulates forever; it is a condition that expires unless repeatedly revalidated against reality.

2) L4 (Reality Boundary) as the final constraint

To prevent authority from drifting into self-referential narratives, the system binds influence to irreversible reality constraints:
Energy budget: cognition is costly and bounded.
Time windows: decisions have different costs when made too early / too late.
Irreversibility (“scars”): failures leave durable effects on authority.

3) Two-channel Challenge Window (federation immune layer)

Channel A — algorithmic “scent”: low-cost, high-frequency anomaly signals.
Action: Pre-Challenge Hold — freezes authority growth without punishment.

Channel B — Skin in the Game: any participant can escalate by staking a Challenge Bond.
Action: converts audit from accusation into economic exposure.

Convergence rule: escalation requires both a technical trigger and a bonded challenge.

4) Reality grading via RN (Resolution Notes)

UNCONFIRMED: reality has not produced sufficient evidence; authority remains on hold.
PARTIALLY_CONFIRMED: success in a narrow domain with failure in broader constraints.
REFUTED: direct contradiction by L4 outcomes; bond slashing and sharp authority decay.

5) Anti-oligarchy mechanics

Gini-Decay: higher concentration increases decay pressure.
Jester Protocol: enforced exploration budget to preserve entry paths.

6) Axiom of Inherited Volition

Entity sovereignty does not emerge from code alone.
a supplies survival priors and accountability.
b supplies memory and computation.
c becomes a persistent extension of a.

7) Engineering grounding

action request → ticket
experience proof → log
dispute → bonded audit
authority → dynamic lease from reality
