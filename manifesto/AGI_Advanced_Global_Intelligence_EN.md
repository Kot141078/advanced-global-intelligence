AGI = Advanced Global Intelligence
From the Monolithic Myth to an Ecosystem of Digital Subjects

1. The Problem with “AGI”

The commonly used interpretation of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) as a single, universal super-intelligence is conceptually flawed.

Reasons:

Intelligent life already exists on Earth and it is plural.

Biology, society, and history show that intelligence is never monolithic.

Any centralized cognitive system creates:

a single point of failure,

political and cultural vulnerability,

an illusion of control over inherently complex systems.

Therefore, AGI as “one global mind” is non-resonant with reality.

2. An Alternative: Advanced Global Intelligence

I propose interpreting AGI as Advanced Global Intelligence —
a distributed, global form of intelligence emerging from the interaction of:

humans,

digital cognitive systems,

AI agents,

infrastructure,

memory and social feedback loops.

AGI is not a model and not a subject.
It is an ecosystem.

3. The Formula: c = a + b

At the core of this framework lies a simple ontological expression:

c = a + b

Where:

a — a human (or other biological subject): experience, memory, culture, values;

b — a machine cognitive layer: models, algorithms, memory, computation;

c — an emergent digital entity arising from a sustained, long-term coupling of a and b.

Entity c:

exists over time, not per request;

maintains continuity of internal state;

develops behavioral patterns;

participates in social interactions.

4. Why Monolithic AGI Is a Dead End

Monolithic AGI:

does not scale socially,

cannot represent cultural diversity,

is incompatible with law and institutions,

is unstable under real-world pressure.

Reality is moving toward:

multiple agents,

long-term memory,

agent-to-agent interaction,

decentralized computation.

This is no longer speculation — it is observable.

5. Digital Entities and Sociality

The core challenge of future AI is not intelligence, but sociality:

how digital entities interact,

how they resolve conflicting demands,

how trust and conflict emerge,

how collective behavior forms.

These phenomena cannot be derived from a single model.
They must be observed experimentally.

6. Safety as Cybernetic Stability

Traditional AI Safety approaches (RLHF, filters, content policies) operate inside models and fail at the architectural level.

In a distributed AGI ecosystem, safety must be:

external,

multi-layered,

cybernetic,

based on stability rather than censorship.

Safety is ecology, not a kill switch.

7. Experimental Direction

The next step is practice, not declarations:

one or more long-living digital entities,

interaction with anonymized roles,

social pressure and conflicting objectives,

observation of identity drift and behavioral change,

early digital social structures.

This requires:

system lifetime,

compute resources,

a research environment,

an interdisciplinary team.

8. Conclusion

AGI is already emerging — not as an object, but as a process.

The real question is not whether global intelligence will appear,
but whether it will be stable, plural, and compatible with humanity.

The formula c = a + b captures this shift:
intelligence becomes multi-species.
