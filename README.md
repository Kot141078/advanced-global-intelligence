# Advanced Global Intelligence (AGI)

This repository contains architecture-first documents, protocols, and integrity manifests
for long-lived, reality-bound digital entities.

The work follows a cybernetic approach to AI safety and governance, grounded in
physical constraints (L4), economic exposure, time, and accountable human anchoring.

## Core Model

**c = a + b**

Where:

- **a** — responsible human anchor  
  (biological, legal, and explicitly accountable)

- **b** — procedures, models, and operational constraints

- **c** — long-lived, accountable digital entity

This repository focuses on **entities**, not stateless tools or disposable agents.

## Comparison with Existing Approaches

The table below clarifies how the AGI / SER stack differs from commonly referenced approaches.
This is **not a feature comparison**, but a comparison of underlying architectural assumptions.

| Dimension | AGI / SER Stack | Sovereign Cloud | AutoGPT / Agent Frameworks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core unit** | Long-lived entity (`c = a + b`) | Tenant / Account | Task / Session |
| **Human role** | Anchoring responsibility and continuity (`a`) | User / Admin | Prompt author |
| **Machine role** | Procedural substrate (`b`) | Compute resource | Tool executor |
| **Memory** | Persistent, degradable, accountable | Centralized storage | Ephemeral / scoped |
| **Authority source** | Verified experience (EA), reality-bound verification (L4) | IAM / policy | None |
| **Reality boundary (L4)** | Explicit, normative | Implicit (billing only) | Ignored |
| **Failure handling** | Designed failure modes | SLA-based | Not architecturally specified |
| **Governance** | Anti-oligarchy, decay, liability | Organizational | None |
| **Primary goal** | **Stability** under real constraints | Availability & control | Task completion |

> **Note:**  
> The AGI / SER stack does not attempt to replace these approaches.  
> They operate at different layers and solve different classes of problems.  
> Direct feature-level comparison is therefore intentionally avoided.

## Repository Structure

- **manifesto/**  
  Architectural syntheses and high-level principles  
  (AGI framing, cybernetic stability, systemic context)

- **protocols/**  
  Formal protocol specifications  
  (c = a + b, L4, federation, governance layers)

- **ontology/**  
  Foundational axioms and conceptual primitives  
  (non-algorithmic grounding of sovereignty and responsibility)

- **architecture/**  
  Whitepapers and system-level designs  
  (decentralized confidential AI, execution models, summaries)

- **background/**  
  Supporting material and regulatory context  
  (EU AI Safety, cybernetic governance background)

- **experiments/**  
  Early-phase and exploratory protocol experiments  
  (non-normative, Phase 0)

- **hashes/**  
  SHA-256 integrity manifests for released and cross-repository artifacts

## Releases

### Latest release: **v1.1 — Protocol L4 + Safety Background + Architecture Pack**

This release publishes the canonical **v1.1 document pack**, including:

- **Protocol:** `c = a + b`  
  (with L4 as an explicit reality-boundary layer)

- **EWCEP v0.1:**  
  Experience-Weighted Co-Evolution Protocol  
  (observed, practice-derived)

- **AI Safety (EU):**  
  cybernetic approach (background)

- **Decentralized confidential AI architecture:**  
  whitepaper and technical roadmap

- **Executive summaries:**  
  EN / FR / RU / DE / NL

**Integrity:**  
Primary SHA-256 manifest:  
`hashes/SHA256SUMS_v1.1.txt`

---

## Post-Release Additions (Non-Normative)

The following architectural texts were added **after the v1.1 release**
and are covered by a **separate integrity addendum**:

- **Cybernetic Stability Manifest v2.0**  
  (architectural synthesis)

- **Axiom of Volition Inheritance (`c = a + b`)**  
  Languages: EN / RU

**Integrity (addendum):**  
`hashes/SHA256SUMS_v1.1_addendum_2026-01-20.txt`

These additions **do not modify the normative scope of v1.1**.  
They extend the architectural and ontological context of the ecosystem.

---

## Cross-Repository Integrity

A cross-repository integrity manifest covering the full  
**SER / AGI architectural stack** is provided here:

- `hashes/SHA256SUMS_stack_v2.0.txt`

This manifest links canonical artifacts across:

- **advanced-global-intelligence**
- **sovereign-entity-recursion**

All referenced paths are stable and canonical.

---

## Integrity Notes

- All integrity manifests use the standard format: <sha256> <relative path>

- Hashes are content-addressed and reproducible.
- Stack manifests do not retroactively alter prior releases.

## Contact & Process

- Issues and pull requests are welcome.
- Architectural discussion is preferred over implementation debate.
- Normative changes require explicit versioning and updated integrity manifests.

This repository prioritizes **architectural stability over velocity**.
