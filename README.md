# Advanced Global Intelligence (AGI)

This repository contains architecture-first documents, protocols, and integrity manifests
for long-lived, reality-bound digital entities.

The work follows a cybernetic approach to AI safety and governance, grounded in
physical constraints (L4), economic exposure, time, and accountable human anchoring.

---

## Core Model

**c = a + b**

Where:

- **a** — responsible human anchor (biological, legal, accountable)
- **b** — procedures, models, and constraints
- **c** — long-lived, accountable digital entity

This repository focuses on **entities**, not stateless tools.

---

## Repository Structure

- **manifesto/**  
  Architectural syntheses and high-level principles  
  (AGI framing, cybernetic stability, systemic context)

- **protocols/**  
  Formal protocol specifications  
  (c = a + b, L4, federation, governance layers)

- **ontology/**  
  Foundational axioms and conceptual primitives  
  (non-algorithmic grounding of sovereignty and responsibility)

- **architecture/**  
  Whitepapers and system-level designs  
  (decentralized confidential AI, execution models, summaries)

- **background/**  
  Supporting material and regulatory context  
  (EU AI Safety, cybernetic governance background)

- **experiments/**  
  Early-phase and exploratory protocol experiments  
  (non-normative, Phase 0)

- **hashes/**  
  SHA-256 integrity manifests for released and cross-repository artifacts

---

## Releases

### Latest release: **v1.1 — Protocol L4 + Safety Background + Architecture Pack**

This release publishes the canonical **v1.1 document pack**, including:

- **Protocol:** c = a + b (with L4 as explicit reality-boundary layer)
- **EWCEP v0.1:** Experience-Weighted Co-Evolution Protocol (observed, practice-derived)
- **AI Safety (EU):** cybernetic approach (background)
- **Decentralized confidential AI architecture:** whitepaper + roadmap
- **Executive summaries:** EN / FR / RU / DE / NL

**Integrity:**  
Primary SHA-256 manifest:  
`hashes/SHA256SUMS_v1.1.txt`

---

## Post-Release Additions (Non-Normative)

The following architectural texts were added **after the v1.1 release**
and are covered by a **separate integrity addendum**:

- **Cybernetic Stability Manifest v2.0**  
  (architectural synthesis)

- **Axiom of Volition Inheritance (c = a + b)**  
  Languages: EN / RU

**Integrity (addendum):**  
`hashes/SHA256SUMS_v1.1_addendum_2026-01-20.txt`

These additions **do not modify the normative scope of v1.1**.  
They extend the architectural and ontological context of the ecosystem.

---

## Cross-Repository Integrity

A cross-repository integrity manifest covering the full **SER / AGI architectural stack**
is provided here:

- `hashes/SHA256SUMS_stack_v2.0.txt`

This manifest links canonical artifacts across:
- **advanced-global-intelligence**
- **sovereign-entity-recursion**

Paths are stable and canonical.

---

## Integrity Notes

- All integrity manifests use the standard format: 
<sha256> <relative path>


- Hashes are content-addressed and reproducible.
- Stack manifests do not retroactively alter prior releases.

## Contact & Process

- Issues and pull requests are welcome.
- Architectural discussion is preferred over implementation debate.
- Normative changes require explicit versioning and updated integrity manifests.

This repository prioritizes **architectural stability over velocity**.
